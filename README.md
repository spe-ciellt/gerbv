# Gerbv - a Gerber viewer
### A local copy for Stefan Petersen, the original author of Gerbv
This is a copy of the original project as of 2015-09-19. I may or may not
follow the original source.

### Use the source
The original source is available from http://gerbv.geda-project.org/, which
also is the proper and original source code.

### The reason
I gave up working on the gerbv many years ago since I had no time when I
started my consulting business.

Since that time it seems many people has passed by this code. Many things
contributed has been stellar, some things contributed has been less than
stellar. Also my own code standard has been updated. Anyhow, I am happy to
see that the program has been kept alive and well during the year.

Since I stopped working on Gerbv the source code has moved from repository
to repository and I have lost my write credentials along the road.

There are also things that I want to experiment with which are are not
necessary "releaseable".
